# Materials Genome Initiative: NLP Informatics

This repo is for a joint project between [Jordan Axelrod](https://github.com/jordanIAxelrod), Defne Circi, [Logan Cooper](https://github.com/ldtcooper), Thomas Lilly, and Shota Miki. It is an attempt to apply NLP techniques to apply sentence-level classifications to materials science papers to make the data contained in them more available to the scientific community.
